Demonstration iOS application - Auto layout constraints playground,
using the Masonry framework
* https://github.com/cloudkite/Masonry.git



Features:
---------
TBD


Usage:
------

Build and run using Xcode5 (or later), targeting iOS7 (or later)

You can optionally add the custom runtime argument `-UIViewShowAlignmentRects YES`, via the scheme editor.
This will render the Auto layout bounding boxes in a yellow wireframe.

This application has also been built to make use of Reveal App (See the Application delegate).
Read their most excellent integration guide to find how to use the Reveal Dynamic Library.
You will need to copy the libReveal.dylib file across to this project folder.
